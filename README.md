It is a website that can be used to note all your plans for each day.

I have used EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for developing this website.

To store the data I have used MogoDB and so anyone has to install Mongo Atlas to run this web on my local server.

This was a personal project which helps me a lot in managing my time.
